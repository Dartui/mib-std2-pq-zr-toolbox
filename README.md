# MIB STD2 Toolbox
‚ö†Ô∏è **Currently is working only on MIB STD2 PQ/ZR Technisat/Preh and is NOT COMPATIBLE with MIB2 STD Delphi and MIB2 HIGH Harman units!** ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Disclaimer
WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE OF YOUR UNIT. YOU ARE DOING EVERYTHING AT YOUR OWN RISK! READ THIS README, USE YOUR BRAIN AND BE CAREFUL!

## Requirements
- Any OBD2 adapter with a software that can enable developer mode (Green Engineering Menu) on the unit
- Empty FAT32 formatted SD card or USB flashdrive, with enough space to save your backups. Everything bigger than 1GB is recommended

## How to install from SD card via "Service Mode" on supported units with navigation
1. Unzip `MIBSTD2-Toolbox-vX.X.X.zip` to the root of SD card. 

NOTE: Additionally, **ONLY** for firmwares 02xx with GEM 3.5, replace `cpu` folder in the root of the SD card with `cpu` folder from `\toolbox\gem` folder.
2. Turn on ignition and insert SD card into slot 1 of the unit
3. Press and hold MENU button to open `Service Mode -> Software Update` and install `MIBStd2_Online_Approval`.
4. Open Green Engineering Menu and have fun üôÇ

Note: This installation method is NOT possible on Seat Navi units with HW H50+ (firmwares 05xx) as metainfo2.txt does not contain variants 47213, 47214, 47215, 47216 and cannot just be edited (because of digital signature at the end of the file).

## How to install via serial console or telnet
1. Unzip `MIBSTD2-Toolbox-vX.X.X.zip` to the root of SD card or USB drive
2. Delete `metainfo2.txt`, this helps to avoid endless reading spinner when connecting USB drive to the unit.
3. Login via console/telnet as root/root
4. Insert SD card or connect USB drive to the unit
5. Enter `mount` to see where inserted card/connected drive is mounted. Usually /media/mp000 is slot SD1, /media/mp001 slot SD2, /media/mp002 port USB1 and so on.
6. Run `ksh /media/mp000/install.sh` to install the toolbox. GEM 3.5 will be automatically updated if found.
7. Open Green Engineering Menu and have fun üôÇ

## How to use the toolbox to do customizations
1. Use `dump` menu to copy files from unit's filesystem into corresponding `dump` subfolder on SD card or USB drive 
2. Modify those files as you wish and copy into corresponding `custom` subfolder on SD card or USB drive
3. Use `customization` menu to copy modified files back to unit's filesystem  

NOTE: Every time you copy files to the unit, scripts will make a backup of original files to `backup` folder on SD card/USB drive. Any time later you can use `restore` functions to revert changes.
