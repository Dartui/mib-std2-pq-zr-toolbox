Note: this screens has the potential to ruin your MIB2 STD unit. The developers are not responsible for any troubles to anyone or anything caused by this toolbox. It's never our intention to harm any person, car or brand. Use the tools wisely, don't be a douche.

## Requirements
- Read the entire readme
- At least 1 healthy set of brains
- An MIB2 STD by Technisat with navigation. It will not work ob MIB2 High or Delphi units!
- 1 empty, FAT32 formatted SD card, with enough space. Everything bigger than 1GB is fine
- Some place to save your backups

## Optional requirements
- Python 3, if you want to extract/compress graphics containers (boot/mcf)
- Picture editing software, if you want to customize graphics files

## How to install
1. Copy everything to SD card
2. Put SD card into slot 1
3. Install it via `Service Menu -> Software Update`
4. After reboot open GreenMenu and run `Install Toolbox` to install all menus and scripts
5. Restart GreenMenu
6. Have fun üôÇ

## How to use
1. Make dumps of the files you want to modify via `dump` menu
2. Dumps will be placed in the corresponding `dump` folder on SD
3. Modify the files how you'd like and place them in the according folder inside `custom` on SD
4. Import modified files via `customization` menu

Notice: Every time you copy files to the unit the script will check if there is a backup. If not, it will make a backup of the original files from to unit to `backup` folder. This way you can always use the `restore` functions to roll back to original.
